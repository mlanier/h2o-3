# The main function of API tests is to make sure that changes to the API are captured
# before the customers do.  This is to prevent breaking the customer code.  If the
# changes are necessary, we will have the chance to warn them about the changes.
#
# All API tests should be short and fast to run.  The main purposes of API tests are to
# make sure that the command in its most popular forms run correctly when user types in
# correct input arguments.  Light weight checking will be provided on the command output
# to make sure that we are getting the correct responses.
#
# For exhaustive tests using all possible combination of input arguments, making sure all
# responses of the API commands are correct, or if in error, the correct error messages
# are sent should be done elsewhere.
